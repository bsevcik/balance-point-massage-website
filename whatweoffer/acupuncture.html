        <p>Acupuncture is a safe, painless and effective way to treat a wide variety of medical problems. It is a proven and effective form of eastern medical treatment that has evolved into a thorough holistic health care system. Practitioners of acupuncture and chinese medicine (L.Ac.) have used this noninvasive treatment method to help millions of people become well and stay well.</p>

<p>Acupuncture is an ancient component of Traditional Chinese Medicine that has been practiced for over 5,000 years. It is based on the idea that a vital energy called “qi” (pronounced “chee”) circulates through the body in a very specific way flowing along channels or meridians.  According to Chinese Medicine, when there is a disruption in the flow of qi through the channels or meridians then pain and/or disease will manifest. Based on this principle, Acupuncturists insert fine needles at specific points along these channels to influence the flow of qi and restore balance to the body. </p>

       <h2 class="centered">Shawna Galicia, L.Ac.</h2>

<img class="imgcenter"src="/Assets/Images/Other%20Images/acupuncture1.jpg" width="135px" height="150px">
<p>Shawna is a board certified licensed acupuncturist and herbalist in the state of California and earned her Masters of Science in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) from Pacific College of Oriental Medicine. Shawna has gained experience working in various capacities in local acupuncture clinics, including Rady Children’s Hospital, as well as abroad where she studied at the Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital under the guidance of well known doctors in China. Before pursuing her Masters in TCM she earned a Bachelors of Science in Psychology from the University of North Texas.</p>

<p>Her interest in Chinese Medicine resulted from her experience  working for a non-profit organization in which she discovered that a person’s health was related to both internal and external factors. In an effort to gain greater understanding of the body as a whole and to help individuals in a deeper and more effective manner, Shawna pursued her education in Traditional Oriental Medicine.</p>

 <p>In addition to traditional Chinese-style acupuncture, Shawna also incorporates Japanese-style acupuncture into her treatments.  This integrated approach helps people achieve their wellness goals through treating both the area of concern and the person as a whole in a way that allows the patient to feel comfortable and get the best results.</p>
