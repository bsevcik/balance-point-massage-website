        <section><h2>Benefits of Massage</h2>
        
          <p> Many of us understand the value of incorporating massage in our daily lives. It is now becoming widely accepted in helping us relieve our daily stress and promoting good health. Massage is nurturing, healing, and helps bring body, mind and spirit into balance.</p>

<p>According to current research almost 80% of all illness can be associated to stress. Research has also shown that massage therapy has the following effects:<br><br>
    · <i>Relieves stress and anxiety</i><br><br>
    · <i>Reduces chronic pain</i><br><br>
    · <i>Improves muscle tone</i><i><br></i><br>
    · <i>Helps prevent injuries</i><br><br>
    · <i>Facilitates chiropractic</i><br><br>
    · <i>Enhances acupuncture</i><br><br>
    · <i>Strengthens immune system</i><br><br>
    · <i>Improves circulation</i><br><br>
    · <i>Lowers blood pressure</i><br><br>
    · <i>Heals the body and soul</i><br><br>
    · <i>Balances energy meridians</i><br><br>
    · <i>Increases peace of mind</i>
    </p>
<p>Massage therapy reduces stress, anxiety, chronic pain, and high blood pressure. It also helps alleviate low back pain, neck pain, sciatica, shoulder pain, headaches and fatigue. It can also help address symptoms of fybromalgia, carpal tunnel syndrome, depression, and anxiety. In addition, it also handles sports related conditions such as illiotibial band syndrome, tendonitis, plantar fascitis and helps prevent injury.</p>

<p>For those that are uncertain about benefits of massage we encourage you to give massage a try. The best judge of how massage can help you is yourself. It is a good first step in addressing many conditions and can help facilitate your bodies natural healing ability. For many, the healing power of touch associated with massage therapy plays a valuable role in achieving greater health and well-being.</p><br>

        <section><h2>Benefits of Acupuncture</h2><br>
        
       
<h3>Low Back Pain</h3>
<p>For a report published in the Annals of Internal Medicine in 2017, researchers analyzed previously published trials on the use of non-pharmacologic therapies (including acupuncture) for low back pain. The report's authors found that acupuncture was associated with decreased pain intensity and better function immediately after acupuncture treatment, compared with no acupuncture. In the long-term, however, the differences were small or were not clear.</p>


<p>Noting that the strength of the evidence was low, the authors found "limited evidence" that acupuncture is "modestly effective for acute low back pain."</p>


<h3>Migraines</h3>
<p>In a 2016 review published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, scientists reviewed 22 previously published trials (involving 4985 participants). In their conclusion, they found that adding acupuncture to the treatment of migraine symptoms may reduce the frequency of episodes, however the size of the effect is small when compared to a sham acupuncture treatment.</p>

<h3>Tension Headaches</h3>
<p>A 2016 review (involving 12 trials and 2349 participants) suggests that acupuncture involving at least six sessions may help people with frequent tension headaches. In two studies, acupuncture added to usual care or treatment at the headache onset only (usually with pain medication) resulted in decreased headache frequency compared to those given usual care only. The researchers note that the specific points used during treatment may play a less important role than previously thought, and that much of the benefit may be due to needling effects.</p>

<h3>Knee Pain</h3>
<p>An analysis of previously published studies found that acupuncture improved physical function in the short and long term in people with chronic knee pain due to osteoarthritis, but it appeared to provide only short-term (up to 13 weeks) relief of pain.</p>

<p>Another review, published in JAMA Surgery, analyzed previous studies on non-pharmacological interventions for pain management after total knee arthroplasty and found evidence that acupuncture delayed the use of patient-controlled use of opioid medication to relieve pain.</p>
