  <h3>How often should a person get a massage?</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
   How often you should get massage depends on two things
1. The quality of the massage
2. The level of stress or type of lifestyle you lead.

If you are receiving massages that are not very good at addressing your needs you will inevitably need more massages. However, if the quality of massage is good then you should need less since the results of the massage should have a more lasting effect.

Secondly, if your lifestyle is very demanding then you will require more massage therapy no matter how good it is. If you are also involved in sports or any type of training regimen we recommend incorporating massage as part of your regimen to help your rest and recovery as well as prevent injury.

A good guideline depending on your budget and your time is to come in every two weeks and if you aren’t able to come in this often then at least once a month. If this is a stretch, then you should come in at least once every 3 months at the minimum.

What types of massage do you offer?

Rather than offer certain types of massage (the types we learned in school) we offer massage that combines different massage styles. All of our therapists know different kinds of massage and we utilize different massage methods and techniques to get results. If we did what we learned in school as a route massage we would limit our techniques to a certain type of massage and thus would limit our ability to effectively gain results. Instead by blending different styles of massage you receive a tailored massage specifically geared to address your body needs.

  <h3>What is a Signature Massage?
</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
    A Signature Massage is an integrative method of massage tailored specifically to address your needs. Combining different styles of massage to get the best results, our therapists integrate skill and intuition to help you feel better, faster!

Your massage typically combines a blend of different massage methods according to your needs and the therapists unique style. We each have our own methods of addressing the body with the main focus of achieving lasting results. You could receive anywhere from 4-8 different methods of massage in any single session. Specific skill combined with the therapists intuition give your massage its own signature.

  <h3>What is Deep Tissue Massage?</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
   Deep Tissue massage is a method of massage intended to address the deeper layers of muscle and myofascial tissues (Thin filament surrounding the muscles). There are many methods of Deep Tissue work but the results are focused on reaching the areas that are, under normal circumstances, untouchable and cause us much pain and distress. You know those ‘knots’ underneath the shoulder blade or muscles so tight that it is hard to penetrate. Deep Tissue work is also used to address injury related conditions to break up scar tissue and promote proper healing of the underlying tissues.
